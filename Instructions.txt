> Due to my absence, please try some of these things:

- write a joshua.py file
    + define functions and names that make sense
    + try to pull only the red pixels from our RGB image (what values do they have?)
- work with Velez and Clune if I don't get there in time
    + Velez probably knows about some easy blob functions to use (even though we want you to try things from scratch)
    + The math is pretty weird, but while I'm getting rid of it, Clune can simply have you solve the little bits.
- Routing (Yes, I have a linksys you can use) ((next week))
