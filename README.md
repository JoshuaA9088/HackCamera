# HackCamera
Hacking a kaicong security camera

---

Getting a security camera to see like we do is
a tough problem, but we'll definitely give it a go!

### Goals?:
* goal one?
* goal two?
* goal three?


### Steps:
1. loading images (/ video)
2. manipulating matricies
3. color/mask/deltas
4. dilation/erosion
5. blob detection / pattern recognition
6. (cameron should have hacked the camera by now)

## In depth:
We need to get images or videos in a format
to compare them (usually in a relationship like
a matrix, which depends on the axis). then we can
compare the relationships between different matrixes.

For instance, we can focus on specific colors,
intensities, or changes in color/intensity.

Next, we can find homogeneous sections ("blobs")
to begin looking at objects, and comparing them
to abstracts.

Unfortunately, cameron's a bit behind on grabbing
the camera information right now. Anyway, functions!

## Built Functions

within cameron.py, I've built a few things to help
out. In particular, you can use `from cameron import *`
to get at all my defined code.
